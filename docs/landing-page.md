## What This Course is About

This course teaches the maintenance and administration of Linux servers in both an on-premises and cloud based environment using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Students will learn to install, configure, test and maintain services commonly used by enterprises in a cloud environment. This course is the second in a series of courses about Linux technologies.

- OPS145 taught you to be a Linux user. 
- OPS245 taught you to be a Linux system administrator.
- OPS345 will teach you to administer and use cloud-based services for DNS, Web server, databases, containers, and other AWS tools.

In this course you will use AWS via the AWS learner lab. The AWS Learner Lab provides a sandbox environment where you can build, configure and deploy AWS assets such as instances. There are some limitations as to what you can do, however it provides all the functionality we require for this course. 

**You are limited to $50 credit at no cost within the learner lab. Once this runs out, your account will be disabled. Additionally, there is no way to add funds to this pool. If you follow the lab instructions properly you should not have any issues.**

## Learning by Doing

Most of the learning in this course occurs through the hands-on problem solving that takes place in the eight labs and two assignments.

## How to run this course

It is strongly recommended that you run this course in a Linux environment such as Mint or Ubuntu. While the majority of the class can be done in a web browser or through a MS Windows terminal, the experience will be most seamless when done in a Linux machine. Lab 6 will include a section that will have problems if you are not running a Linux machine.

There are a few options for you to consider. You can:
- Install your own flavour of Linux to your own personal laptop
- Use your Debian 13 install from second semester (or create a new install the same way you did in OPS245 with an external hard drive)
- Install a virtual machine either in your own Windows environment on your own laptop

If you are unsure, just ask your teacher!
