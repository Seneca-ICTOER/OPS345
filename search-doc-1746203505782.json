These services allow you to take an application you have built and turn it into a high capacity available application: meaning users will not see any degradation in performance regardless of how many users are connected. In the case of your Wordpress site, you will not have a high number of users trying to access it at any given time. However, the concepts of auto scaling and load balancing are part of what has lead to the popularity of the cloud. Load balancing can also be done (on premises) using things like a hardware load balancer or by installing and configuring a service such as HA Proxy (on a unique server).  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs.  AWS auto scaling requires some configuration options, such as:  Metric: Metric used for your Auto Scaling trigger.Statistic: Statistic calculation the trigger should use, such as Average.Unit: Unit for the trigger metric, such as Bytes.Period: Specifies how frequently Amazon CloudWatch measures the metrics for your trigger.Breach duration: Amount of time, in minutes, a metric can be outside of the upper and lower thresholds before triggering a scaling operation.Upper threshold: If the metric exceeds this number for the breach duration, a scaling operation is triggered.Scale up increment: The number of Amazon EC2 instances to add when performing a scaling activity.Lower threshold: If the metric falls below this number for the breach duration, a scaling operation is triggered.Scale down increment: The number of Amazon EC2 instances to remove when performing a scaling activity.

There are four types of gateways  Internet Gateway​  An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.  An internet gateway enables resources in your public subnets (such as EC2 instances) to connect to the internet if the resource has a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. Similarly, resources on the internet can initiate a connection to resources in your subnet using the public IPv4 address or IPv6 address. For example, an internet gateway enables you to connect to an EC2 instance in AWS using your local computer.  Egress-only Internet Gateway​  An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.  An egress-only internet gateway is for use with IPv6 traffic only. To enable outbound-only internet communication over IPv4, use a NAT gateway instead.  Carrier Gateway​  A carrier gateway is a VPC component that allows connectivity between AWS and your on-premises network using AWS Direct Connect or AWS Site-to-Site VPN. It is specifically designed for use with AWS Outposts, enabling communication between your Outposts and the internet, or between your Outposts and other AWS services. The carrier gateway supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and provides a highly available and redundant connection.  A carrier gateway is used when you need to connect your Outposts to the internet or to other AWS services, ensuring that your on-premises applications can communicate seamlessly with AWS resources.  NAT Gateway​  A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.  When you create a NAT gateway, you specify one of the following connectivity types:  Public – (Default) Instances in private subnets can connect to the internet through a public NAT gateway, but cannot receive unsolicited inbound connections from the internet. You create a public NAT gateway in a public subnet and must associate an elastic IP address with the NAT gateway at creation. You route traffic from the NAT gateway to the internet gateway for the VPC. Alternatively, you can use a public NAT gateway to connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network. In this case, you route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. Private – Instances in private subnets can connect to other VPCs or your on-premises network through a private NAT gateway. You can route traffic from the NAT gateway through a transit gateway or a virtual private gateway. You cannot associate an elastic IP address with a private NAT gateway. You can attach an internet gateway to a VPC with a private NAT gateway, but if you route traffic from the private NAT gateway to the internet gateway, the internet gateway drops the traffic.  A NAT gateway is for use with IPv4 traffic only. To enable outbound-only internet communication over IPv6, use an egress-only internet gateway instead.  You are going to create an Internet Gateway.

Linux software and updates come from special sources hosted on other servers, known as repositories (or repos). All the major Linux distros host their own repos, though anyone can host a repository for a distribution - and many organizations do. Due to the Open Source nature of Linux, certain repos may contain specialized software that is not available in the main repository (such as EPEL - Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux); or they may contain a mirror of the main repo. Accessing these and installing software requires using your Linux distro's command line package management tool. The major ones you will encounter when you use Linux are:  APT (Aptitude Package Manager): This is used in Debian based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Kali Linux.DNF (Dandified Yum): Which is an update of YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified). Both of these operate as a front end for RPM (Red Hat Package Manager). These are used in Red Hat based Linux distros.Pacman (Pacman Package Manager): This is used in Arch Linux, as well as a few others.Zypper Package Manager: This is used in OpenSUSE, which is popular for use on servers in Europe.

However, Elastic Beanstalk applications are meant to be disposable.  Normally, when you add that database connector info, it is saved in a file called wp-config.php on the webserver VM. This is fine for a traditional setup. However, in Elastic Beanstalk, changes made to static HTML or PHP are not saved if the Beanstalk application restarts, which it will do often. Whenever the application restarts, it will reload from the source zip file and the original, empty connector file. If you did this the traditional way, you'd have to constantly re-enter your DB connector info every time you started up your Learner Lab environment.  We could add the DB connector info to wp-config.php manually before we upload the source code, but there's a much better way.  We use environment variables to allow us to put all the info in the Elastic Beanstalk application wizard directly. That way, every time the application restarts and reloads from the source code zip, it'll then read our saved connector information from AWS itself. Read below for details and steps.  Note: All other information, like the Wordpress website name, users, theme settings, blog posts, etc., are saved in the actual database you created in RDS. This database does not get reset when the Elastic Beanstalk application restarts, so your actual blog data will remain intact.
